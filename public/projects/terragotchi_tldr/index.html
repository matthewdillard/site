        <blockquote>
<p><em>Tend to your own pocket-sized Earth by learning and practicing sustainable behaviors and mindsets, supported by constructive strategies for navigating climate anxiety.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Terragotchi is a concept app researched, designed, and developed between January-May 2025 as my Capstone Project for the UX Design Masters Program at the Maryland Institute College of Art. The app combines resource wiki, habit tracking, mindfulness, and virtual-pet gamification to educate, encourage, and strengthen sustainable lifestyles while providing guidance on navigating climate anxiety.</p>
<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Climate change is the most critical issue of our time, but its scope often leaves people feeling overwhelmed and paralyzed. Young people in particular experience high levels of climate anxiety, yet lack clear pathways to action or an understanding of how their individual choices matter. This anxiety creates avoidance patterns that prevent engagement with sustainable behaviors.</p>
<p><strong>Key Question:</strong> How might we redirect climate anxiety into climate action, cultivate ecological awareness, and support young people in defining and aspiring towards a sustainable lifestyle in a fun and engaging way?</p>
<h2 id="research-insights">Research Insights</h2>
<p>Through competitive analysis, literature review, SME interviews, and user research, I identified several key insights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Disconnection:</strong> Urban living and abstract metrics create a disconnection from natural environments and the impacts of individual actions.</li>
<li><strong>Barriers to action:</strong> Knowledge gaps, social norms, personal capacity, and poor infrastructure inhibit sustainable behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Incentives:</strong> Effective motivation comes from accessible information, personal benefits, positive framing, and enjoyable experiences.</li>
<li><strong>User patterns:</strong> Two key mindsets emerged – the <em>Conflicted Environmentalist</em> (aspiration &amp; guilt) and the <em>Anxious Amateur</em> (anxiety &amp; paralysis).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p>Terragotchi addresses these challenges through four integrated features:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Action Library:</strong> Curated sustainable behaviors with varying difficulty levels and detailed impact information</li>
<li><strong>Habit Tracking:</strong> Personalized goal-setting and progress visualization</li>
<li><strong>Mindfulness Exercises:</strong> Tools to navigate climate anxiety and redirect negative energy</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Pet:</strong> A pocket-sized Earth that responds to and encourages sustainable actions</li>
</ol>
<p>The app&rsquo;s philosophy centers on treating sustainability as socioecological well-being, prioritizing positivity, and focusing on what&rsquo;s within each person&rsquo;s control.</p>
<h2 id="outcome">Outcome</h2>
<p>Usability testing revealed that users found the mindfulness activities particularly effective at grounding anxiety and providing clear next steps. The breakdown of environmental, personal, and community benefits helped users understand interconnected impacts and increased motivation.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>While the core functionality provides a solid foundation, future iterations could expand to include social engagement features, enhanced gamification, and communication tools to facilitate cross-generational climate discussions.</p>
