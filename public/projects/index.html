    <h2><a href="/projects/aegisonic/">SECT Aegisonic</a></h2>
    <p>Aegisonic is a project developing an adaptive audio headset designed to support individuals with heightened sound sensitivity and autism, offering a comfortable, equitable sonic experience for all.</p>
<p>Founded by my friend Harry Rentzeperis, Aegisonic was kickstarted during a Mt. Sinai development program, and I&rsquo;ve served as design advisor through the project launch, responsible for brand, strategy, communication, and user-experience.</p>
<p>Aegisonic was selected as a winner at the 2025 DIH Pitch Day.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/projects/injury-coder/">SECT Injury Coder</a></h2>
    <p>I designed a tool to help trauma center registrars accurately code patient injuries accurately under significant time constraints in high-stakes healthcare settings.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We just want a streamlined process that we can feel confident is accurate.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Patient data accuracy is critical for trauma centers because of it affects research, funding, operations, and quality of care. It&rsquo;s the responsibility of only a handful of registrars to process upwards of thousands of patients that a trauma center takes in annually. To do this, registrar&rsquo;s must diligently scour clinical records to identify patient diagnoses, then apply the appropriate AIS &amp; ICD-10 injury codes to the patient&rsquo;s registry record for that patient as accurately as possible.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tend to your own pocket-sized Earth by learning and practicing sustainable behaviors and mindsets, supported by constructive strategies for navigating climate anxiety.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Terragotchi is a concept app researched, designed, and developed between January and May 2025 for my UX Design Masters Capstone Project at the <a href="https://www.mica.edu/graduate-programs/ux-design-mps/">Maryland Institute College of Art</a>, seeking to educate &amp; cultivate everyday sustainable behaviors like socioecological well-being, with a focus on mindfulness, positivity, and fun.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/projects/rw-taxonomy/">SECT Report Writer Taxonomy</a></h2>
    <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>When company leadership approached me to enhance our flagship report writing tool&rsquo;s &ldquo;look and feel,&rdquo; I instead argued that improving the information architecture would be a better use of company resources, addressing fundamental accessibility barriers rather than apply cosmetic fixes.</p>
<p>Advocating for systematic information architecture improvements was not just an economical and robust way to reduce mental fatigue for our users working in high-pressure clinical environments, but also to reduce cognitive barriers that affect all users — but disproportionately impact those with varying information processing needs.</p>

    <h2><a href="/projects/post-gold/">SECT Post Gold typeface</a></h2>
    <p>In the year after graduation, I got into a habit of saving small wisdoms I&rsquo;d happen across to Post-its which accumulated on the wall of my home office. I used the sum of these handwriting exhibitions to develop a typeface, which you can check out by typing within the sticky note below:</p>

    <h2><a href="/projects/john-carroll/">SECT The John Carroll School</a></h2>
    <p>I designed and developed a modernized web presence for the <a href="https://www.johncarroll.org/">John Carroll School</a>. This was my first significant professional project, working independently to meet design, development, and client management needs.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>As part of a larger software agreement between my company and John Carroll, I was responsible for rebuilding the school website, which had become costly to maintain, poorly integrated with their data systems, and failed to communicate effectively with prospective families. Information architecture was unclear, and WCAG accessibility violations made the site both difficult to navigate and visually unappealing. The administration believed these shortcomings negatively impacted enrollment, community engagement, and their ability to connect with alumni.</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/projects/landing-page/">SECT Landing page builder</a></h2>
    <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
<p>Small, non-profit organizations excel in advocating and accelerating their causes. However, several factors—ranging from a lack of expertise and funds to intimidation by technology—make it difficult to establish or maintain an online presence.</p>
<p>A well-crafted website can significantly amplify their efforts, bringing outsized benefits to their cause, so the question then arises: How can we simplify the process for these organizations to create and grow their online presence? How can we increase engagement and exposure for their initiatives with a website?</p>
