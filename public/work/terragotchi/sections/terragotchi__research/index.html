        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>I employed multiple research methods to understand the problem space and identify potential solutions:</p>
<h3 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>I analyzed three sustainability-focused apps, and one wellness app which served as a major source of inspiration:</p>
<h4 id="commons">Commons</h4>
<p><em>Connecting users with sustainable brands and rewarding eco-friendly purchases.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Leverages economic forces; low-effort, compelling alternatives for necessary purchases</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Limited education material; actions not representative of accessible everyday behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="klima">Klima</h4>
<p><em>Carbon offset subscriptions based on a carbon-footprint calculation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Best carbon footprint calculator; clear breakdown and visualization of impact; simple and straight-forward carbon offset</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Education content could be more digestible; lacks regular engagement incentives; subscription model easy to disengage with</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="one-small-step">One Small Step</h4>
<p><em>Teaching sustainable skills with guided lessons and progress tracking.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Most extensive action library; effective journey-based approach; community engagement features; compelling metadata</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Centrally focused on carbon footprint; no support for climate anxiety;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="finch">Finch</h4>
<p><em>Utilizing a virtual pet to encourage well-being and self-care practices.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Leveraging instinct to nurture; popular with younger audiences; many features and patterns which encourage consistent engagement</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Apply similar gamification principles that encourage behaviors that benefit the environmental, as well as the user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-research">User Research</h3>
<p>I conducted 6 interviews with individuals aged 20-25 who expressed high concern about climate change but varying levels of action. Key insights included:</p>
<h4 id="disconnection-vs-connection">Disconnection vs. connection</h4>
<p>Urban living creates distance from nature, making it harder to internalize environmental impacts — the more immediate, visible, and personal the problem, the more likely it will motivate change.</p>
<p>However, even brief outdoor experiences improve well-being, promote environmental awareness, and create positive associations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the problem is so like zoomed out and I&rsquo;m small part of it and it&rsquo;s so hard to see that impact&hellip; People talk about tons of CO2&hellip; that is a meaningless metric to me.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="barriers-to-action">Barriers to action</h4>
<p>Three primary barriers emerged: lack of actionable knowledge, discouraging social norms, and limited personal capacity. Convenience (e.g. sustainable infrastructure) and sacrifice of living standards also influenced behavior adoption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know what there is to do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="incentives-for-action">Incentives for action</h4>
<p>Effective motivation requires compelling alternatives rather than behavior change pressure. The most sustainable motivations are personal and positively-focused, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible, balanced information:</strong> Information that balances urgency with self-efficacy</li>
<li><strong>Personal benefits:</strong> Highlighting health, well-being, and skill development</li>
<li><strong>Positive framing:</strong> Focusing on aspiration rather than obligation</li>
<li><strong>Enjoyable experiences:</strong> Making sustainable actions fun or social</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;if the version of myself that I see at the end of that is something that I aspire to be like, then like I am motivated to do that.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If someone were to tell me that every time that you throw out a battery, this happens&hellip; I&rsquo;d probably be more likely to recycle batteries.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="research-impact--takeaways">Research impact &amp; takeaways</h4>
<p>My takeaway from the research I conducted is perhaps best summed up with a piece of advise from a subject matter expert I spoke with: <em>If you want to change behavior, don&rsquo;t change people — give them a compelling alternative instead.</em></p>
<p>So, knowing that awareness precedes understanding, and understanding precedes action, this project would need to combine education and incentive if it hoped to cultivate more sustainable lifestyles.</p>
