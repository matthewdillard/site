        <h1>Terragotchi Overview</h1>
        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Terragotchi is a concept app I researched, designed, and developed between January-May 2025 as my UX Design Masters Capstone Project at the Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>
<p>Terragotchi seeks to cultivate sustainable self-efficacy by addressing climate anxiety within an engaging, educational, and supportive digital experience. Terragotchi combines a resource wiki, habit tracking, mindfulness exercises, and virtual-pet gamification into a resource that educates, encourages, and strengthens sustainable lifestyles. Importantly, it also provides guidance on navigating climate anxiety and channeling that energy into positive action.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h3>
<p>I centered this project around consisted of three key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treating sustainability as socioecological well-being — something beneficial for both people and the planet</li>
<li>Prioritizing positivity, because fighting for something is more powerful than fighting against something</li>
<li>Focusing on what&rsquo;s within each&rsquo;s control, recognizing that no one can do it all, but that everyone must do what they can</li>
</ul>
