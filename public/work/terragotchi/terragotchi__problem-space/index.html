<h3 id="climate-change-anxiety-and-action">Climate Change, Anxiety, and Action</h3>
<p>Climate change is the most critical issue of our time, with indisputable costs and threats. While we have the resources, technology, and knowledge to address it, there is a failure to effectively apply them to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Governments and private industry are each positioned to address climate, but they are slow and profit-driven, respectively. Public opinion and collective action, on the other hand, have the capacity to reshape the fabric of society from the ground-up, and become greatest change of all.</p>
<p>However, the individual action necessary to achieve this is impaired by several factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Disconnection:</strong> Shifts towards more urban living have disconnected people from nature, rendering them unable to see how their actions impact the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overwhelming complexity:</strong> Climate issues are conveyed at scales feel beyond anyone&rsquo;s individual influence, and use metrics that lack personal relevance (e.g. tons of CO2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anxiety spiral:</strong> Anxiety is the fear of an uncertain future, and a condition which results in behavioral avoidance patterns and paralysis instead of action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No one is more representative of these conditions than the youngest generations. They exhibit the highest levels of awareness and concern towards climate change, yet also experience the most anxiety, fear, and anger. They are prone to deflect responsibility onto older generations who they feel are most to blame, while doubting their own ability to make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How might we redirect climate anxiety into climate action, cultivate ecological awareness, and support the development and agency of young people to define and aspire towards a sustainable lifestyle in a fun and engaging way?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>No one has more at stake than the youngest generations, and so it&rsquo;s critically important that they be able to navigate the crisis at hand, and have the confidence, skills, and awareness to cultivate a more sustainable society.</p>
