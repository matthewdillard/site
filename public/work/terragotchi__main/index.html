<blockquote>
<p><em>Tend to your own pocket-sized Earth by learning and practicing sustainable behaviors and mindsets, supported by constructive strategies for navigating climate anxiety.</em></p></blockquote>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Terragotchi is a concept app I researched, designed, and developed between January-May 2025 as my UX Design Masters Capstone Project at the Maryland Institute College of Art. The project aimed to cultivate sustainable self-efficacy by addressing climate anxiety within an engaging, educational, and supportive digital experience.</p>
<p>At its core, Terragotchi combines a resource wiki, habit tracking, mindfulness exercises, and virtual-pet gamification into a resource that educates, encourages, and strengthens sustainable lifestyles. Importantly, it also provides guidance on navigating climate anxiety and channeling that energy into positive action.</p>
<p>The philosophy I centered this project around consisted of three key principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treating sustainability as socioecological well-being — something beneficial for both people and the planet</li>
<li>Prioritizing positivity, because fighting for something is more powerful than fighting against something</li>
<li>Focusing on what&rsquo;s within each&rsquo;s control, recognizing that no one can do it all, but that everyone must do what they can</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problem-space">Problem Space</h2>
<h3 id="climate-change-anxiety-and-action">Climate Change, Anxiety, and Action</h3>
<p>Climate change is the most critical issue of our time, with indisputable costs and threats. While we have the resources, technology, and knowledge to address it, there is a failure to effectively apply them to the problem at hand.</p>
<p>Governments and private industry are each positioned to address climate, but they are slow and profit-driven, respectively. Public opinion and collective action, on the other hand, have the capacity to reshape the fabric of society from the ground-up, and become greatest change of all.</p>
<p>However, the individual action necessary to achieve this is impaired by several factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Disconnection:</strong> Shifts towards more urban living have disconnected people from nature, rendering them unable to see how their actions impact the environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Overwhelming complexity:</strong> Climate issues are conveyed at scales feel beyond anyone&rsquo;s individual influence, and use metrics that lack personal relevance (e.g. tons of CO2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anxiety spiral:</strong> Anxiety is the fear of an uncertain future, and a condition which results in behavioral avoidance patterns and paralysis instead of action.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>No one is more representative of these conditions than the youngest generations. They exhibit the highest levels of awareness and concern towards climate change, yet also experience the most anxiety, fear, and anger. They are prone to deflect responsibility onto older generations who they feel are most to blame, while doubting their own ability to make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="problem-statement">Problem Statement</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How might we redirect climate anxiety into climate action, cultivate ecological awareness, and support the development and agency of young people to define and aspire towards a sustainable lifestyle in a fun and engaging way?</em></p></blockquote>
<p>No one has more at stake than the youngest generations, and so it&rsquo;s critically important that they be able to navigate the crisis at hand, and have the confidence, skills, and awareness to cultivate a more sustainable society.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p>I employed multiple research methods to understand the problem space and identify potential solutions:</p>
<h3 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>I analyzed three sustainability-focused apps, and one wellness app which served as a major source of inspiration:</p>
<h4 id="commons">Commons</h4>
<p><em>Connecting users with sustainable brands and rewarding eco-friendly purchases.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Leverages economic forces; low-effort, compelling alternatives for necessary purchases</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Limited education material; actions not representative of accessible everyday behaviors</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="klima">Klima</h4>
<p><em>Carbon offset subscriptions based on a carbon-footprint calculation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Best carbon footprint calculator; clear breakdown and visualization of impact; simple and straight-forward carbon offset</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Education content could be more digestible; lacks regular engagement incentives; subscription model easy to disengage with</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="one-small-step">One Small Step</h4>
<p><em>Teaching sustainable skills with guided lessons and progress tracking.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Most extensive action library; effective journey-based approach; community engagement features; compelling metadata</li>
<li><strong>Opportunities:</strong> Centrally focused on carbon footprint; no support for climate anxiety;</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="finch">Finch</h4>
<p><em>Utilizing a virtual pet to encourage well-being and self-care practices.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Leveraging instinct to nurture; popular with younger audiences; many features and patterns which encourage consistent engagement</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Apply similar gamification principles that encourage behaviors that benefit the environmental, as well as the user</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-research">User Research</h3>
<p>I conducted 6 interviews with individuals aged 20-25 who expressed high concern about climate change but varying levels of action. Key insights included:</p>
<h4 id="disconnection-vs-connection">Disconnection vs. connection</h4>
<p>Urban living creates distance from nature, making it harder to internalize environmental impacts — the more immediate, visible, and personal the problem, the more likely it will motivate change.</p>
<p>However, even brief outdoor experiences improve well-being, promote environmental awareness, and create positive associations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the problem is so like zoomed out and I&rsquo;m small part of it and it&rsquo;s so hard to see that impact&hellip; People talk about tons of CO2&hellip; that is a meaningless metric to me.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="barriers-to-action">Barriers to action</h4>
<p>Three primary barriers emerged: lack of actionable knowledge, discouraging social norms, and limited personal capacity. Convenience (e.g. sustainable infrastructure) and sacrifice of living standards also influenced behavior adoption.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know what there is to do.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="incentives-for-action">Incentives for action</h4>
<p>Effective motivation requires compelling alternatives rather than behavior change pressure. The most sustainable motivations are personal and positively-focused, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accessible, balanced information:</strong> Information that balances urgency with self-efficacy</li>
<li><strong>Personal benefits:</strong> Highlighting health, well-being, and skill development</li>
<li><strong>Positive framing:</strong> Focusing on aspiration rather than obligation</li>
<li><strong>Enjoyable experiences:</strong> Making sustainable actions fun or social</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;if the version of myself that I see at the end of that is something that I aspire to be like, then like I am motivated to do that.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If someone were to tell me that every time that you throw out a battery, this happens&hellip; I&rsquo;d probably be more likely to recycle batteries.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="research-impact--takeaways">Research impact &amp; takeaways</h4>
<p>My takeaway from the research I conducted is perhaps best summed up with a piece of advise from a subject matter expert I spoke with: <em>If you want to change behavior, don&rsquo;t change people — give them a compelling alternative instead.</em></p>
<p>So, knowing that awareness precedes understanding, and understanding precedes action, this project would need to combine education and incentive if it hoped to cultivate more sustainable lifestyles.</p>
<h2 id="user-types--opportunities">User Types &amp; Opportunities</h2>
<p>From my research, I observed and identified two distinct behavioral patterns, which I called:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conflicted environmentalist</li>
<li>Anxious Amateur</li>
</ul>
<p>I applied them each to the Modes and Mindsets framework, which focuses on the mindsets, context, and needs of a given user.</p>
<h3 id="conflicted-environmentalist">Conflicted Environmentalist</h3>
<p>Exhibiting <em>aspiration</em> and <em>guilt</em>, these individuals have strong environmental values, established habits, and a desire to improve. However, when circumstances force them behave or act less sustainably, they struggle with guilt as their ideals conflict with reality. These individuals need guidance working within their own limitations, and the ability to adapt and refine their sustainable habits while staying consistent.</p>
<h3 id="anxious-amateur">Anxious Amateur</h3>
<p>Exhibiting <em>anxiety</em> and <em>paralysis</em>, these individuals have limited sustainable awareness, but feel they should be doing more — especially when they experience environmental degradation first hand. But without clear pathways, their uncertainty becomes anxiety, which leads to avoidance or disengagement. These individuals need accessible, practical information, clear goals, and strategies for processing negative thought patterns constructively.</p>
<h3 id="design-opportunities">Design Opportunities</h3>
<p>From these patterns, I identified five key opportunity areas:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Action Library</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Personally relevant and accessible actions</li>
<li>Varied difficulty levels and customization options</li>
<li>Suggestions based on current habits and interests</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information Resources</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clear what/why/how for actions</li>
<li>Digestible information back up by sources</li>
<li>Benefits for the environmental, and the user</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Habit Tracking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Management and prioritization of action goals</li>
<li>Flexible adaptation of personal behaviors</li>
<li>Progress visualization</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mindfulness Exercises</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Structure and guidance navigating negative emotions</li>
<li>Techniques to redirect anxiety into action</li>
<li>Environmental mindfulness practices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gamification</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual pet for accountability and care</li>
<li>Positive reinforcement</li>
<li>Playful, lighthearted approach</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="future-state-journeys">Future State Journeys</h3>
<h2 id="design-process">Design Process</h2>
<h3 id="aesthetics--resources">Aesthetics &amp; Resources</h3>
<p>For Terragotchi&rsquo;s visual language, I aimed to create something simple, playful, and practical. I drew inspiration from education apps like <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, and <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, as well as the aforementioned wellness app <a href="https://finchcare.com/">Finch</a>.</p>
<p>The pet Earth is a custom vector graphic sourced from a hand-drawn sketch, animated within Figma, and the Terragotchi typemark is derived from my own handwriting. I used <a href="phosphor.com">Phosphor</a> for the iconography and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quick">Quicksand</a> as typeface.</p>
<p>With UI that shares balanced, rounded lines, and branding that comes hand-made, I aimed to create a visual language that was friendly, playful, and unique.</p>
<h3 id="iterative-development">Iterative Development</h3>
<p>I moved from low-fidelity sketches to mid and high-fidelity prototypes, conducting usability testing at each major stage. The testing focused on six key tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Onboarding and orientation</li>
<li>Adding an action</li>
<li>Finding related actions</li>
<li>Completing an adaptive thinking exercise</li>
<li>Logging an action</li>
<li>Viewing personal progress</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="testing-iterations">Testing iterations</h3>
<h4 id="adaptive-thinking-exercises">Adaptive thinking exercises</h4>
<p>The adaptive thinking exercises proved to be the most impactful feature. After reading a potentially anxiety-inducing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-chaos-warming-15-pollution-carbon-832773cebb14b4ea8c8930580537e567">climate article</a>, participants completed an activity informed by Cognitive Behavior Therapy principles, which helped them process their emotional state and get actionable next steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The article is just telling you everything, and the only thing you can do is absorb&hellip; with the app there isn&rsquo;t a way that you can lose, you can only progress.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to take a second and ask &rsquo;now what?&rsquo;&hellip; it&rsquo;s a question that never gets asked.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="action-information">Action Information</h4>
<p>I structured action information to highlight three types of benefits: environmental, personal, and community. Testing revealed that users responded most strongly to personal benefits, followed by environmental impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be most interested to see how does this action benefit me&hellip; followed by environmental benefits.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>By showing impacts from individual up to the global level, users could better understand how actions — which they may not have even considered sustainable — could benefit themselves, their communities, and the planet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think about all of the ways that these things interact with each other&hellip; I could easily see one of these bullets be something that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of as a benefit.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="action-completion">Action Completion</h4>
<p>The interaction for logging completed actions evolved significantly through testing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Version 1:</strong> Saved actions remained fixed after logging, but users expected them to disappear like they would in to-do apps</li>
<li><strong>Version 2:</strong> Actions collapsed away after logging, but the checkmark icon confused users, who thought it meant the action was already complete</li>
<li><strong>Version 3:</strong> Log action button now had a plus icon, the checkmark now serving a role in the completion micro-interaction</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="action-discovery">Action Discovery</h4>
<p>The information architecture involved in finding new and related actions also underwent multiple revisions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Version 1:</strong> Related actions resided within individual action screens</li>
<li><strong>Version 2:</strong> Added a &ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; tab to the Action Library after I observed users instinctively going there to find actions</li>
<li><strong>Version 3:</strong> Flexible filtering and search was implemented after category-based navigation was identified to be creating decision fatigue</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="final-solution">Final Solution</h2>
<p>Terragotchi&rsquo;s final design integrates four key features into a cohesive experience:</p>
<h3 id="home--gamification">Home &amp; Gamification</h3>
<p>The home screen centers on your personal Terragotchi and the sustainable actions the user is seeking to perform. By completing actions, users give health to their pet Earth, and earn experience points which showcases their own growth and progress.</p>
<h3 id="action-library">Action Library</h3>
<p>A comprehensive collection of sustainable behaviors, each with tags and metadata, allows users to find actions that are of interest, and within their abilities. Action impact is broken down into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental impact</li>
<li>Personal benefits</li>
<li>Community benefits
Each action also contains resources to learn more, and related action to encourage building off current behaviors.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="action-tracking">Action Tracking</h3>
<p>The actions completed and associated growth users make is tracked and visualized within a progress tab. A radar chart allows them to see which areas they&rsquo;ve developed most, and a heat map displays their consistency and action density.</p>
<h3 id="mindset-tools">Mindset Tools</h3>
<p>Guided exercises help users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process feelings about climate news</li>
<li>Break out of anxiety spirals</li>
<li>Develop environmental mindfulness</li>
<li>Reinforce channeling energy into positive action</li>
</ul>
<p>The app&rsquo;s strength comes from the integration of these features — providing the education, incentive, and support for sustainable living — while addressing the emotional barriers that often prevent action to develop sustainable self-efficacy.</p>
<h2 id="results--reflection">Results &amp; Reflection</h2>
<h3 id="user-feedback">User Feedback</h3>
<p>Usability testing showed that Terragotchi successfully addressed key user needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mindfulness exercises effectively redirected anxiety into action</li>
<li>The multi-benefit approach to incentivizing action improved resonance</li>
<li>The virtual pet was fun, encouraging, and motivated consistency</li>
<li>The action library offered diversity that could meet a variety of lifestyles</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-development">Future Development</h3>
<p>While the core functionality provides a solid foundation, there were many areas which I wish I could have explored — some of which users even expressed a desire for. Some of these included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Social engagement:</strong> Community and social engagement reliably came up in research as a way to support behavior (e.g. accountability, guidance, competition), along with making the experience more fun, and making individuals feel less alone in trying to define a more sustainable future.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced gamification:</strong> Particularly for younger audiences, gamification showed high potential as an incentive and way to add fun to the app experience. Just a few ways to further gamify Terragotchi would have been more micro-interactions, in-app challenges, and collectibles.</li>
<li><strong>Communication tools:</strong> The importance of sharing both experience and knowledge when it came to climate issues — particularly across generations — made this area the hardest to omit. Mad-Lib style conversation starters did not make the cut, but the effectiveness of prompt-based engagement through the mindfulness exercises suggests its potential.</li>
<li><strong>Education and lessons:</strong> Action impact and benefits were included, but <em>how</em> to perform particular actions was delegated to external resources. Furthermore, having more interactive lessons would make it so that information is not just given, but really engaged with, would increase the change of material being internalized.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h3>
<p>This project reinforced several important principles which I believe will affect the work that I will do next, and my day-to-day perspective:.</p>
<ul>
<li>Systems facilitate behavior change more effectively than willpower alone</li>
<li>Awareness precedes understanding, and understanding precedes action</li>
<li>Positive framing creates more sustainable motivation than guilt or fear</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to the project management itself, I further learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stand on the shoulders of giants</li>
<li>There are no shortcuts — the only way out is through</li>
<li>You can always define a more precise problem (and often should)</li>
</ul>
