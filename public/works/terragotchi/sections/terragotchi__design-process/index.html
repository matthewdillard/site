        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p> this is a test</p>
        <h2 id="design-process">Design Process</h2>
<h3 id="aesthetics--resources">Aesthetics &amp; Resources</h3>
<p>For Terragotchi&rsquo;s visual language, I aimed to create something simple, playful, and practical. I drew inspiration from education apps like <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant</a>, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://quizlet.com/">Quizlet</a>, and <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>, as well as the aforementioned wellness app <a href="https://finchcare.com/">Finch</a>.</p>
<p>The pet Earth is a custom vector graphic sourced from a hand-drawn sketch, animated within Figma, and the Terragotchi typemark is derived from my own handwriting. I used <a href="phosphor.com">Phosphor</a> for the iconography and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quick">Quicksand</a> as typeface.</p>
<p>With UI that shares balanced, rounded lines, and branding that comes hand-made, I aimed to create a visual language that was friendly, playful, and unique.</p>
<h3 id="iterative-development">Iterative Development</h3>
<p>I moved from low-fidelity sketches to mid and high-fidelity prototypes, conducting usability testing at each major stage. The testing focused on six key tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Onboarding and orientation</li>
<li>Adding an action</li>
<li>Finding related actions</li>
<li>Completing an adaptive thinking exercise</li>
<li>Logging an action</li>
<li>Viewing personal progress</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="testing-iterations">Testing iterations</h3>
<h4 id="adaptive-thinking-exercises">Adaptive thinking exercises</h4>
<p>The adaptive thinking exercises proved to be the most impactful feature. After reading a potentially anxiety-inducing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-chaos-warming-15-pollution-carbon-832773cebb14b4ea8c8930580537e567">climate article</a>, participants completed an activity informed by Cognitive Behavior Therapy principles, which helped them process their emotional state and get actionable next steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The article is just telling you everything, and the only thing you can do is absorb&hellip; with the app there isn&rsquo;t a way that you can lose, you can only progress.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice to take a second and ask &rsquo;now what?&rsquo;&hellip; it&rsquo;s a question that never gets asked.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="action-information">Action Information</h4>
<p>I structured action information to highlight three types of benefits: environmental, personal, and community. Testing revealed that users responded most strongly to personal benefits, followed by environmental impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be most interested to see how does this action benefit me&hellip; followed by environmental benefits.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>By showing impacts from individual up to the global level, users could better understand how actions — which they may not have even considered sustainable — could benefit themselves, their communities, and the planet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think about all of the ways that these things interact with each other&hellip; I could easily see one of these bullets be something that I hadn&rsquo;t thought of as a benefit.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<h4 id="action-completion">Action Completion</h4>
<p>The interaction for logging completed actions evolved significantly through testing:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Version 1:</strong> Saved actions remained fixed after logging, but users expected them to disappear like they would in to-do apps</li>
<li><strong>Version 2:</strong> Actions collapsed away after logging, but the checkmark icon confused users, who thought it meant the action was already complete</li>
<li><strong>Version 3:</strong> Log action button now had a plus icon, the checkmark now serving a role in the completion micro-interaction</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="action-discovery">Action Discovery</h4>
<p>The information architecture involved in finding new and related actions also underwent multiple revisions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Version 1:</strong> Related actions resided within individual action screens</li>
<li><strong>Version 2:</strong> Added a &ldquo;Suggested&rdquo; tab to the Action Library after I observed users instinctively going there to find actions</li>
<li><strong>Version 3:</strong> Flexible filtering and search was implemented after category-based navigation was identified to be creating decision fatigue</li>
</ol>
