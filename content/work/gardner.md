I designed a logo for a personal Cirrus aircraft instructor, stylizing her initials (EG) into a bold blue rudder to convey her desired brand qualities of sophistication, innovation, performance, and adventure to her wealthy clientele.

>Learning how to fly a Cirrus is like learning how to drive in a Ferrari. 

For wealthy individuals seeking their own private aircraft (e.g., CEOs, professional athletes, celebrities), time is money, so learning to fly isn't like your typical flight lessons. Instructors are highly specialized and their training schedule to their clients, often traveling to where they are, and teaching them by flying the routes they wanted their personal plane for. 

>If they need to fly from NYC to Florida for a golf tournament, I will do that with them and we will conduct training on the way

For her brand, this Cirrus instructor sought a brand that was characterized by quality and sophistication, while being dynamic and innovative. She wanted her brand to balance bespoke expertise, with performance and adventure.
