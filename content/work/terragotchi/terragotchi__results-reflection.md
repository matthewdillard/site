## Final Solution

Terragotchi's final design integrates four key features into a cohesive experience:

### Home & Gamification
The home screen centers on your personal Terragotchi and the sustainable actions the user is seeking to perform. By completing actions, users give health to their pet Earth, and earn experience points which showcases their own growth and progress.

### Action Library
A comprehensive collection of sustainable behaviors, each with tags and metadata, allows users to find actions that are of interest, and within their abilities. Action impact is broken down into:
- Environmental impact
- Personal benefits
- Community benefits
Each action also contains resources to learn more, and related action to encourage building off current behaviors.

### Action Tracking
The actions completed and associated growth users make is tracked and visualized within a progress tab. A radar chart allows them to see which areas they've developed most, and a heat map displays their consistency and action density.

### Mindset Tools
Guided exercises help users:
- Process feelings about climate news
- Break out of anxiety spirals
- Develop environmental mindfulness
- Reinforce channeling energy into positive action

The app's strength comes from the integration of these features — providing the education, incentive, and support for sustainable living — while addressing the emotional barriers that often prevent action to develop sustainable self-efficacy.
