## Design Process

### Aesthetics & Resources

For Terragotchi's visual language, I aimed to create something simple, playful, and practical. I drew inspiration from education apps like [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/), and [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/), as well as the aforementioned wellness app [Finch](https://finchcare.com/).

The pet Earth is a custom vector graphic sourced from a hand-drawn sketch, animated within Figma, and the Terragotchi typemark is derived from my own handwriting. I used [Phosphor](phosphor.com) for the iconography and [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?query=quick) as typeface.

With UI that shares balanced, rounded lines, and branding that comes hand-made, I aimed to create a visual language that was friendly, playful, and unique.

### Iterative Development

I moved from low-fidelity sketches to mid and high-fidelity prototypes, conducting usability testing at each major stage. The testing focused on six key tasks:

1. Onboarding and orientation
2. Adding an action
3. Finding related actions
4. Completing an adaptive thinking exercise
5. Logging an action
6. Viewing personal progress

### Testing iterations

#### Adaptive thinking exercises
The adaptive thinking exercises proved to be the most impactful feature. After reading a potentially anxiety-inducing [climate article](https://apnews.com/article/climate-change-chaos-warming-15-pollution-carbon-832773cebb14b4ea8c8930580537e567), participants completed an activity informed by Cognitive Behavior Therapy principles, which helped them process their emotional state and get actionable next steps.

> "The article is just telling you everything, and the only thing you can do is absorb... with the app there isn't a way that you can lose, you can only progress."

> "It's nice to take a second and ask 'now what?'... it's a question that never gets asked."

#### Action Information
I structured action information to highlight three types of benefits: environmental, personal, and community. Testing revealed that users responded most strongly to personal benefits, followed by environmental impact.

> "I'd be most interested to see how does this action benefit me... followed by environmental benefits."

By showing impacts from individual up to the global level, users could better understand how actions — which they may not have even considered sustainable — could benefit themselves, their communities, and the planet.

> "You don't think about all of the ways that these things interact with each other... I could easily see one of these bullets be something that I hadn't thought of as a benefit."

#### Action Completion
The interaction for logging completed actions evolved significantly through testing:

1. **Version 1:** Saved actions remained fixed after logging, but users expected them to disappear like they would in to-do apps
2. **Version 2:** Actions collapsed away after logging, but the checkmark icon confused users, who thought it meant the action was already complete
3. **Version 3:** Log action button now had a plus icon, the checkmark now serving a role in the completion micro-interaction 

#### Action Discovery
The information architecture involved in finding new and related actions also underwent multiple revisions:

1. **Version 1:** Related actions resided within individual action screens
2. **Version 2:** Added a "Suggested" tab to the Action Library after I observed users instinctively going there to find actions
3. **Version 3:** Flexible filtering and search was implemented after category-based navigation was identified to be creating decision fatigue
