## Research

I employed multiple research methods to understand the problem space and identify potential solutions:

### Competitive Analysis

I analyzed three sustainability-focused apps, and one wellness app which served as a major source of inspiration:
#### Commons 
*Connecting users with sustainable brands and rewarding eco-friendly purchases.*
- **Strengths:** Leverages economic forces; low-effort, compelling alternatives for necessary purchases
- **Opportunities:** Limited education material; actions not representative of accessible everyday behaviors
#### Klima 
*Carbon offset subscriptions based on a carbon-footprint calculation.*
- **Strengths:** Best carbon footprint calculator; clear breakdown and visualization of impact; simple and straight-forward carbon offset
- **Opportunities:** Education content could be more digestible; lacks regular engagement incentives; subscription model easy to disengage with
#### One Small Step
*Teaching sustainable skills with guided lessons and progress tracking.*
- **Strengths:** Most extensive action library; effective journey-based approach; community engagement features; compelling metadata
- **Opportunities:** Centrally focused on carbon footprint; no support for climate anxiety; 
#### Finch 
*Utilizing a virtual pet to encourage well-being and self-care practices.*
- **Strengths:** Leveraging instinct to nurture; popular with younger audiences; many features and patterns which encourage consistent engagement
- **Inspiration:** Apply similar gamification principles that encourage behaviors that benefit the environmental, as well as the user

### User Research

I conducted 6 interviews with individuals aged 20-25 who expressed high concern about climate change but varying levels of action. Key insights included:
#### Disconnection vs. connection
Urban living creates distance from nature, making it harder to internalize environmental impacts — the more immediate, visible, and personal the problem, the more likely it will motivate change. 

However, even brief outdoor experiences improve well-being, promote environmental awareness, and create positive associations.

> "...the problem is so like zoomed out and I'm small part of it and it's so hard to see that impact... People talk about tons of CO2... that is a meaningless metric to me."
#### Barriers to action
Three primary barriers emerged: lack of actionable knowledge, discouraging social norms, and limited personal capacity. Convenience (e.g. sustainable infrastructure) and sacrifice of living standards also influenced behavior adoption.

> "I don't really know what there is to do."
#### Incentives for action
Effective motivation requires compelling alternatives rather than behavior change pressure. The most sustainable motivations are personal and positively-focused, including:
- **Accessible, balanced information:** Information that balances urgency with self-efficacy
- **Personal benefits:** Highlighting health, well-being, and skill development
- **Positive framing:** Focusing on aspiration rather than obligation
- **Enjoyable experiences:** Making sustainable actions fun or social

> "...if the version of myself that I see at the end of that is something that I aspire to be like, then like I am motivated to do that."

>"If someone were to tell me that every time that you throw out a battery, this happens... I'd probably be more likely to recycle batteries."

#### Research impact & takeaways
My takeaway from the research I conducted is perhaps best summed up with a piece of advise from a subject matter expert I spoke with: *If you want to change behavior, don't change people — give them a compelling alternative instead.* 

So, knowing that awareness precedes understanding, and understanding precedes action, this project would need to combine education and incentive if it hoped to cultivate more sustainable lifestyles.
