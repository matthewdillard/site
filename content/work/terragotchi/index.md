## Overview

Terragotchi is a concept app I researched, designed, and developed between January-May 2025 as my UX Design Masters Capstone Project at the Maryland Institute College of Art. 

Terragotchi seeks to cultivate sustainable self-efficacy by addressing climate anxiety within an engaging, educational, and supportive digital experience. Terragotchi combines a resource wiki, habit tracking, mindfulness exercises, and virtual-pet gamification into a resource that educates, encourages, and strengthens sustainable lifestyles. Importantly, it also provides guidance on navigating climate anxiety and channeling that energy into positive action.

### Philosophy
I centered this project around consisted of three key principles:
- Treating sustainability as socioecological well-being — something beneficial for both people and the planet
- Prioritizing positivity, because fighting for something is more powerful than fighting against something
- Focusing on what's within each's control, recognizing that no one can do it all, but that everyone must do what they can
