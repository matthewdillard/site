## User Types & Opportunities

From my research, I observed and identified two distinct behavioral patterns, which I called:
- Conflicted environmentalist
- Anxious Amateur

I applied them each to the Modes and Mindsets framework, which focuses on the mindsets, context, and needs of a given user.
### Conflicted Environmentalist
Exhibiting *aspiration* and *guilt*, these individuals have strong environmental values, established habits, and a desire to improve. However, when circumstances force them behave or act less sustainably, they struggle with guilt as their ideals conflict with reality. These individuals need guidance working within their own limitations, and the ability to adapt and refine their sustainable habits while staying consistent.
### Anxious Amateur
Exhibiting *anxiety* and *paralysis*, these individuals have limited sustainable awareness, but feel they should be doing more — especially when they experience environmental degradation first hand. But without clear pathways, their uncertainty becomes anxiety, which leads to avoidance or disengagement. These individuals need accessible, practical information, clear goals, and strategies for processing negative thought patterns constructively.

### Design Opportunities

From these patterns, I identified five key opportunity areas:

1. **Action Library**
   - Personally relevant and accessible actions
   - Varied difficulty levels and customization options
   - Suggestions based on current habits and interests

2. **Information Resources**
   - Clear what/why/how for actions
   - Digestible information back up by sources
   - Benefits for the environmental, and the user

3. **Habit Tracking**
   - Management and prioritization of action goals
   - Flexible adaptation of personal behaviors
   - Progress visualization

4. **Mindfulness Exercises**
   - Structure and guidance navigating negative emotions
   - Techniques to redirect anxiety into action
   - Environmental mindfulness practices

5. **Gamification**
   - Virtual pet for accountability and care
   - Positive reinforcement
   - Playful, lighthearted approach
