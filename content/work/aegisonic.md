Aegisonic is a project developing an adaptive audio headset designed to support individuals with heightened sound sensitivity and autism, offering a comfortable, equitable sonic experience for all. 

Founded by my friend Harry Rentzeperis, Aegisonic was kickstarted during a Mt. Sinai development program, and I've served as design advisor through the project launch, responsible for brand, strategy, communication, and user-experience. 

Aegisonic was selected as a winner at the 2025 DIH Pitch Day. 

Aegisonic will join the Mt. Sinai Incubator in early 2026.
