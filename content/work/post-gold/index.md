In the year after undergrad, I made a habit of saving wisdoms I encountered to Post-its which accumulated on the wall by my desk. I curated these handwriting exhibitions to develop a typeface that you can try for yourself by clicking in the sticky note below:

{{< postit >}}

{{<figure
  src="/images/postit-wall.jpg"
  alt="Post-it notes on a wall."
  class="ar-p cv"
>}}
