I joined DICORP, Inc. in 2022, serving as the first & only designer in the healthcare software company's nearly 40-year history. My primary responsibilities are user-experience, graphic, and web design, with additional roles in research, development, IT, branding, and communications. 

I've pioneered user-centric design, contributing a perspective that challenges the status quo

As one man team, I've developed my skills as a communicator—championing and educating design to clients, engineers, and leadership—and as an architect—creating the systems and infrastructure that enable everyone to design.

Working and collaborating alongside clients, engineers, and leadership figures

- props for introducing new perspectives, new practices, new approaches
	- contrasting/complementing experienced, engineering-centric team
- numerous mentions of value added, not having anyone like me before, needing someone to approach problems like I have
- consulting on problems, explaining not just what but why, and giving people resources to build with good design themselves (e.g. Landing Pages)
	- "old" by software standards, many many years of work—can't overhaul things → need to work with what I have
	- Led me to current documentation efforts
- Quotes/testimonials from JK, BG, JV
